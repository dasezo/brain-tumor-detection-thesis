Traditionally, radiologists rely on \glsxtrshort{mri} scans to detect brain tumors, While this method is effective, it also has limitations analyzing hundreds of scans manually is time consuming and prone to human error. That is where technology comes in. With recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, we now have powerful tools that can learn from medical images and help with faster and more accurate diagnosis.

In this project, we focus on building a hybrid system to detect brain tumors and determine whether they are low-grade or high-grade. We use a \glsxtrshort{unet} model for segmenting the tumor regions in MRI images. After identifying these regions, we extract important features and feed them into a Support Vector Machine (\glsxtrshort{svm}) classifier to make the final prediction.

We use the BraTS2020 dataset, focusing on T2-weighted FLAIR images, to train and test our system. Our goal is to create a pipeline that is not only technically sound but also practical and helpful for medical professionals in real-world settings.
