\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become indispensable in medical imaging, offering tools that can assist—and in some cases outperform—radiologists in detecting and characterizing pathologies. In the context of brain tumors, AI-driven methods enable rapid and accurate identification of tumor boundaries and grading, directly impacting treatment planning and patient outcomes.

\section{What is Artificial Intelligence?}

Artificial Intelligence (\glsxtrshort{ai}) is a multidisciplinary field focused on developing machines and computer programs capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, reasoning, decision making, and language understanding. According to \cite{sciencedirect_ai_overview}, AI is defined as:

\begin{quotation}
  "the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines, particularly intelligent computer programs that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, decision making, and language translation."
\end{quotation}

In other words, AI includes both the study of human cognition—how people perceive, learn, reason, and decide—and the development of algorithms and systems that can perform tasks requiring "intelligence," such as visual recognition or decision making. While some AI techniques draw inspiration from biological processes (e.g. neural networks), the field also embraces purely mathematical and statistical methods.

\section{Machine Learning}
\label{sec:ml}
Machine learning (\glsxtrshort{ml}) has emerged as a crucial area of study for organizations aiming to harness data resources and gain deeper insights into their operations. Unlike traditional programming methods, where explicit instructions are coded, machine learning enables systems to learn directly from data. In the medical imaging field, ML techniques offer powerful ways to analyze complex MRI data, supporting more accurate and efficient diagnostic processes. However, machine learning is a complex process that involves using diverse algorithms to iteratively learn from data, refine data representations, and make predictions. By feeding training data into these algorithms, increasingly accurate models can be developed. These machine learning models represent the knowledge acquired by algorithms during the training phase \cite{hurwitz2018mlfd}.

\subsection{History of Machine Learning}
\label{sec:ml_history}
The history of machine learning represents a fascinating journey from theoretical concepts to practical implementations that have transformed various industries, including healthcare and medical imaging.

The foundations of machine learning can be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s, when early pioneers began exploring computational models that could learn from data:

\begin{itemize}
  \item In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed the first mathematical model of neural networks \cite{mcculloch1943logical}.
  \item In 1950, Alan Turing introduced the "Turing Test" in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing a test for machine intelligence \cite{turing1950computing}.
  \item In 1952, Arthur Samuel developed the first computer learning program—a checkers game that improved through self-play \cite{samuel1959studies}.
  \item In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt created the perceptron, an early algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}.
\end{itemize}

The 1960s and 1970s saw both advances and setbacks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The "nearest neighbor" algorithm was developed, forming the basis for pattern recognition systems \cite{cover1967nearest}.
  \item Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert's book "Perceptrons" \cite{minsky1969perceptrons} highlighted limitations of single-layer neural networks, contributing to reduced funding during the first "AI winter."
\end{itemize}

The resurgence began in the 1980s with several important developments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decision tree algorithms like ID3 by Ross Quinlan \cite{quinlan1986induction}.
  \item The backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks \cite{rumelhart1986learning}.
  \item The development of the support vector machine (SVM) by Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues \cite{vapnik1995nature}.
\end{itemize}

The 1990s and 2000s brought machine learning into mainstream applications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ensemble methods like Random Forests \cite{breiman2001random} and boosting algorithms \cite{freund1997decision}.
  \item Practical applications in spam filtering, recommendation systems, and early computer vision.
  \item The Netflix Prize competition (2006-2009) highlighted the power of collaborative filtering and ensemble methods.
\end{itemize}

In medical imaging specifically, machine learning techniques began making significant impacts with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Development of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for mammography in the 1990s \cite{chan1990computer}.
  \item Application of SVMs and random forests to tumor classification in the early 2000s \cite{zhang2004breast}.
  \item The transition to deep learning approaches for medical image analysis starting around 2012.
\end{itemize}

This historical progression has laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated machine learning systems that can detect subtle patterns in medical images, predict disease progression, and assist in treatment planning.

\subsection{Why Machine Learning?}
\label{sec:why_ml}
Machine learning offers several compelling advantages that have driven its adoption in medical imaging and other fields:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition in Complex Data}: Machine learning excels at discovering patterns in high-dimensional data that may be imperceptible to human observers. For medical imaging, this means identifying subtle tissue abnormalities or correlations that might otherwise be missed.

  \item \textbf{Automation of Repetitive Tasks}: ML algorithms can automate time-consuming aspects of image analysis, freeing radiologists to focus on interpretation and clinical decision-making rather than routine measurements or screenings.

  \item \textbf{Quantitative Assessment}: Unlike qualitative human evaluations that may vary between observers, machine learning provides consistent, quantitative measurements of disease characteristics, potentially reducing inter-observer variability.

  \item \textbf{Integration of Multimodal Data}: Modern ML methods can combine information from multiple imaging modalities (MRI, CT, PET) along with clinical data to provide more comprehensive analysis than would be possible with any single data source.

  \item \textbf{Predictive Capabilities}: Beyond current state assessment, machine learning can predict disease progression or treatment response based on patterns learned from large datasets of prior patients.

  \item \textbf{Personalized Medicine}: ML algorithms can identify subgroups of patients with similar characteristics or disease presentations, enabling more tailored treatment approaches.

  \item \textbf{Continuous Learning}: Machine learning systems can be designed to improve over time as they process more data, unlike traditional rule-based systems that remain static unless manually updated.

  \item \textbf{Cost-Effectiveness}: By improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, machine learning can reduce unnecessary tests, treatments, and hospitalizations, potentially lowering healthcare costs.
\end{itemize}

In brain tumor analysis specifically, machine learning offers the ability to precisely delineate tumor boundaries, distinguish between tumor types and grades, differentiate tumor from surrounding edema, and monitor treatment response with greater objectivity and consistency than visual assessment alone.

\subsection{History of Deep Learning}
\label{sec:dl_history}
The history of deep learning spans several decades, with key developments occurring in distinct waves of innovation. The foundational concept of artificial neural networks dates back to 1943 when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed a computational model of neurons \cite{mcculloch1943logical}. The field progressed with Frank Rosenblatt's introduction of the perceptron in the late 1950s, which demonstrated the ability to perform simple pattern recognition \cite{rosenblatt1958perceptron}.

However, the field faced significant challenges in the 1970s after Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published "Perceptrons" \cite{minsky1969perceptrons}, highlighting the limitations of single-layer neural networks. This initiated what is now known as the "AI winter," a period of reduced funding and interest in neural network research.

The 1980s saw a resurgence with the development of backpropagation by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart, and Ronald Williams \cite{rumelhart1986learning}, enabling effective training of multi-layer networks. However, computational limitations prevented widespread adoption of deeper architectures.

The modern era of deep learning began in the 2000s with several breakthrough developments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton introduced deep belief networks with an effective layer-by-layer pre-training method \cite{hinton2006fast}.
  \item In 2012, AlexNet, developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton, dramatically outperformed traditional computer vision algorithms in the ImageNet competition \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}.
  \item Subsequent years saw the development of increasingly sophisticated architectures such as VGGNet, GoogLeNet/Inception, and ResNet, each advancing the state-of-the-art in various tasks.
\end{itemize}

In the medical imaging domain, a significant milestone was the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Ronneberger et al. \cite{ronneberger2015unet}, specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation, demonstrating deep learning's capacity to address specialized healthcare challenges.

\subsection{Why Deep Learning?}
\label{sec:why_dl}
Deep learning offers several distinct advantages that have fueled its adoption across numerous domains, particularly in medical imaging:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Automatic Feature Extraction}: Unlike traditional machine learning that relies on handcrafted features, deep learning automatically discovers relevant features from raw data, eliminating the need for domain-specific expertise in feature engineering.

  \item \textbf{Hierarchical Feature Learning}: Deep networks learn representations at multiple levels of abstraction. Lower layers capture basic patterns (e.g., edges in images), while higher layers combine these to represent complex concepts (e.g., textures, objects, or tumor characteristics).

  \item \textbf{Scalability with Data}: Deep learning models continue to improve as more data becomes available, unlike many traditional algorithms that plateau in performance. This is particularly relevant in medical imaging as dataset sizes continue to grow.

  \item \textbf{Transfer Learning}: Knowledge gained from one task can be transferred to another, reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data for each new application—crucial in medical domains where annotated data is often scarce.

  \item \textbf{End-to-End Learning}: Deep learning can learn directly from raw input to desired output, eliminating intermediate processing steps that might introduce biases or errors.

  \item \textbf{Handling Unstructured Data}: Medical images, natural language reports, and other unstructured data that constitute most healthcare data are particularly well-suited for deep learning approaches.
\end{itemize}

In the context of brain tumor analysis, deep learning excels at identifying subtle patterns in MRI images that might be imperceptible to human observers, potentially leading to earlier detection and more precise characterization of pathologies.

The hardware landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with emerging technologies like neuromorphic computing and photonic computing promising even greater efficiency for neural network computations in the future.

\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}
\label{sec:cnn}
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of neural network with a topology similar to a grid, inspired by the human brain. It is commonly used for image processing tasks, as well as natural language processing.

A CNN consists of two main parts. The input is an image, represented as a 2D matrix of pixels for grayscale images and a 3D matrix of pixels for color images (Red, Green, Blue).

The first part of a CNN is the convolutional layer, which acts as a feature extractor. The image is passed through a series of filters, or convolution kernels, to generate new images called feature maps. Some intermediate filters reduce the image resolution. Finally, the feature maps are concatenated to form a vector of features, known as the CNN code.

The output of the convolutional layer, the CNN code, is the input to the second part of the network. The main role of this part is to combine the features of the CNN code to classify the image. The output is a final layer with one neuron per category.

\subsubsection{Convolutional Layer}
\label{sec:conv}

The convolutional layer is the most important layer and usually the first layer in a CNN. It consists of three main elements involved in the convolution operation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Input image} ($f$)
  \item \textbf{Feature detector (filter)} ($h$)
  \item \textbf{Feature map (output)} ($G$)
\end{itemize}

A convolution takes an image and a filter as input and applies the convolution operation to produce a new image, called the activation map or feature map.

The activation map values are calculated using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
  G[m,n] \;=\; (f * h)[m,n]
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $f$ is the input image,
  \item $h$ is the convolution filter,
  \item $m,n$ are the spatial indices over which the convolution is computed.

\end{itemize}

  \label{fig:conv}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Correction Layer (ReLU)}

The Correction Layer, typically implemented using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), is an activation function applied after each convolution operation to enhance processing efficiency. It replaces all negative pixel values with zero, introducing non-linearity into the network while maintaining computational simplicity. The ReLU function is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  f(x) = \max(0, x)
\end{equation}

Several other activation functions exist, such as the sigmoid function, the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh), and the hyperbolic saturating tangent function. However, ReLU is often preferred in deep learning models because it enables faster convergence and better performance compared to these alternatives.

\subsubsection{Pooling Layers}

Pooling layers are utilized to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while preserving the most important information and features. This helps decrease computational complexity and mitigate overfitting. There are several types of pooling operations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Max Pooling}:
        It selects the maximum value from each patch of the feature map. Typically, a $2 \times 2$ patch is used. Max pooling is the most commonly used pooling method.

  \item \textbf{Min Pooling}:
        The inverse of max pooling; it selects the minimum value from each patch of the feature map.

  \item \textbf{Average Pooling}:
        It computes the average of all the values within each patch of the feature map by summing the values and dividing by the number of elements.

  \item \textbf{Sum Pooling}:
        It computes the sum of all elements within each patch of the feature map.

  \item \textbf{Flattening}:
        After the pooling operations, the resulting feature maps are flattened into a single one-dimensional vector to prepare for fully connected (dense) layers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fully Connected Layer}

after the convolution and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done in fully connected layers. The output of flattening is the input of FC layers which are the same as artificial neural networks and carry out the same mathematical operations. The last fully-connected layer uses an activation function such as sigmoid or softmax to get probabilities of the outputs.



\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this chapter, we established the theoretical foundation necessary for our study on brain tumor analysis using artificial intelligence techniques. We began by exploring the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, highlighting their evolutionary development and significance in the medical imaging domain. We examined various machine learning approaches and algorithms, with particular emphasis on supervised learning methods and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification tasks. The chapter then delved into deep learning methodologies, focusing on the architecture and operational principles of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their key components—convolutional layers, pooling mechanisms, and fully connected layers. Finally, we presented the U-Net architecture, a specialized CNN model designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation, which forms a crucial component in the segmentation phase of our proposed hybrid approach. This comprehensive theoretical background provides the necessary context for understanding the practical implementation and performance evaluation of our models in the subsequent chapters.
