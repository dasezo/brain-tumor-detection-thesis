Brain tumors are among the most serious neurological disorders, requiring accurate and timely diagnosis. This thesis presents an automated system for brain tumor detection using deep learning and machine learning techniques. A U-Net model is trained for semantic segmentation of brain MRI scans (FLAIR modality), identifying tumor regions. Extracted radiomic features—such as area, intensity, and shape—are used to classify tumors into High-Grade Glioma (HGG) or Low-Grade Glioma (LGG) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The system addresses class imbalance using SMOTE and demonstrates promising results on the BraTS2020 dataset. This hybrid approach offers a practical tool for tumor analysis and classification.
