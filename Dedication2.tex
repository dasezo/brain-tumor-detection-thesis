\textit{To my parents, whose unwavering love, support, and guidance have been instrumental in shaping my dreams; to my family, who have been my rock and my safe haven; and to my friends, who have been the source of joy and laughter in my life.}

This thesis is a reflection of their sacrifices, a testament to their faith in me, and a celebration of the bond we share. Thank you for being my pillars of strength and my endless source of inspiration.\\
